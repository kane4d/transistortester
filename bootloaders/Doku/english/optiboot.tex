\chapter{The optiboot boot-loader for AVR Micro-controllers}

\section*{}
The optiboot Boot-loader has been created with C language by Peter Knight and
Bill Westfield. I have used the version 6.2 as base
for the here described revised Assembler version.
I would like to underline, that I did not reinvent the
optiboot boot-loader. I have just done some optimizing.
Many adaptions to several target processors and special
board level systems are present with the version 6.2.
The program use parts of the STK500 communication protocol,
which is released with AVR061~\cite{stk500} from Atmel.


\section{Changes and enhancements to the version 6.2}
Basically I have translated the total program in the assembler language
and have adapted the Makefile, that the program length will
be processed automatically to select the start address of the boot-loader
and set the right fuses for the program length.
The selected solution generates some small files during some
interim steps, which are required to solve the following steps
to select the right start address and the right fuses.
The start address of the boot-loader for any target processor
depends on the present flash size, the flash requirement
of the boot-loader code and the tile size, which is supported
by the target processor for bootlace.
The tile size is the smallest boot-loader size, which can be supported
by the selected target processor.


For processors like the ATtiny84, which don't support the boot-loader start function,
the page size of the flash memory is used for this calculation.
For the ATtiny84 this are 64 Bytes. Therefore the start address of
the boot-loader is always located at the begin of a flash page.

For all other supported target processors the boot-loader area can be
selected with the fuse bits BOOTSZ1 and BOOTSZ0 (each with the values 0 and 1).
If you put together the both bits, you get a coded boot-loader size
with values between 0 and 3.
Always the value of 3 select the smallest possible boot-loader area.
A value of 2 select a double size, the value 1 the quadruple size
and the value 0 select a size of eight times the smallest size.
The table~\ref{tab:bootsz} at page~\pageref{tab:bootsz} shows a 
overview for the several target processors.

\section{Automatic size adaption in the optiboot Makefile}

The boot-loader start address and the required boot-loader size will
be adapted automatically with the Makefile.
For the calculation some interim files are created,
which is only possible together with some Linux tools:

\begin{description}
\item [bc] a simple calculator, which can operate with input and output-
values in decimal and hexadecimal values.
\item [cat] put the file content to the standard output.
\item [cut] can select part of lines of a text.
\item [echo] shows the specified text at standard output.
\item [grep] shows only lines of a text file which contain the specified string.
\item [tr] can replace or erase characters.
\end{description}

Until now this function of the Makefile is only tested with a Linux system.
Probably a use with the Windows system is only possible,
if you install the Cygwin package.

You don't handle the different interim files in normal case.
Here I would like to refer the names and the meaning:
\begin{description}
\item [BootPages.dat] hold the count of required pages by the boot-loader.
For processors which support the boot-loader start feature, the value can be only 1, 2, 4, or 8 and
specifies how many times the minimum size of the boot-loader area (tile) is used.
With the virtual boot-loader support the number can be any value and
specifies the count of required flash pages.
\item [BOOTSZ.dat] hold a number between 0 and 3 for selection of the  BOOTSZ0 and BOOTSZ1 bits.
\item [BL\_StartAdr.dat] hold the start address of the boot-loaders with hexadecimal format.
The start address is computed with the flash size of the selected target processor and
the count of required page or tile size.
\item [EFUSE.dat] hold the value for the efuse in hexadecimal format.
The Makefile determine depending of the target processor type,
if this file is used or not.
\item [HFUSE.dat] hold the value for the hfuse in hexadecimal format.
The Makefile determine depending of the target processor type,
if this file is used or not.
\end{description}

\section{target selection for the optiboot Makefile}

The control of steps for generating the program data from
the source code is defined in the Makefile.
Except the main Makefile there are three additional extension Makefiles,
which are included by the main Makefile:
Makefile.1284, Makefile.atmel, and Makefile.extras .
There can exist different configurations for the same processor type.
The table~\ref{tab:processors} shows different basic configuration
for several target processors.
In principle this list can be extended.
You can select some parameters also with the make call or by setting
a environment variable  of the shell.

\section{The Options for the optiboot Makefile}

With the options you can select the feature of the optiboot boot-loader.
For example you can select with the option SOFT\_UART, that a software solution
is used for the serial communication.
Without this option a integrated hardware UART is used for serial communication.
The pin TX (Transmit) is used for serial output and the pin RX (Receive) is used
for serial input. If more than one UART is present at the target processor,
the first interface with the number 0 is used.
But you can also select every other present UART by specify the number with
the option UART (UART=1 for the second present UART).
For the hardware UART interfaces the pins for transmit and receive are fixed
to the specific pins. For the serial communication with software you can
select any pins, which are able to do digital input and output.
More details for the available options you can find in the tables~\ref{tab:options1}
and \ref{tab:options2}

When operating with the internal RC generator, it is quite possible that a serial data transfer
not immediately succeed. This is principle independent of whether the hardware UART interface
or a software solution (SOFT\_UART) is used.
Without additional measurement you can only try with estimated OSCCAL\_CORRECTION values.
Probably the data sheet of the AVR processor can help a little bit.
Here is described at which operating voltage and at what temperature the RC oscillator
was calibrated. 
In addition here is also described the gradient of frequency change with operating voltage,
temperature and OSCCAL modification.

More options are listed in table~\ref{tab:options2} . 
Some of these options are only interesting for software checks and
for processors without the boot-loader support.

\section{Usage of optiboot without a boot-loader area}

For processors without a special boot-loader area in the flash memory, for example the ATtiny84,
a solution is selectable to use the optiboot anyway.
This function can be selected with the VIRTUAL\_BOOT\_PARTITION option.
To start the boot-loader first with every Reset of the processor, the interrupt
vector table of the application program is changed.
At the reset vector location a jump to the optiboot program is registered.
The original start address of the application program will be moved to
another interrupt vector the ''replacement reset vector''.
This interrupt vector should not be used by the application program.
If the boot-loader does not receive any data from the serial interface within
a appropriate time, the boot-loader jump to the location of the replacement
reset vector and start the application program.
The figure~\ref{fig:VectorMove} should illustrate these changes.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[]{../FIG/VectorMove.eps}
\caption{Changes of program data by optiboot}
\label{fig:VectorMove}
\end{figure}

At the left side the content of the program data file (.hex) is shown.
Just to the right the content of the flash memory is shown, as it is modified by the
optiboot boot-loader. At two interrupt vector addresses the content is changed.
At the reset vector address 0 the jump is modified to select the optiboot start address 
as jump target.
At the ''replacement vector address'' 4 the original jump target address of the application
program's reset vector is used as new jump target address of this vector.
One of the problems with this modification is, that usually the program data
is verified by the host after write is finished.
To provide any error message by verify the program data, the optiboot return the
program data without its own modification, not the real content of the interrupt vector table.
The jump target address of the reset vector can be reconstructed with the content
of the replacement vector address.
But the original content of the replacement vector would be lost because there is no
place to save the original content in the flash memory.
Therefore optiboot use the last two places of the EEprom memory to save this original
content of the replacement vector. 
So the verify of the program data is possible without errors, as long as the application
program do not use one of the last two EEprom locations.
Even if the application program use one of the last two EEprom locations,
the boot-loader will be unaffected. Only the program verify by the host is
no longer possible without a error message.
An error message will occur at the location of the replacement interrupt vector.

For processors with more than 8 kByte flash memory two instruction words are used for every
interrupt vector. Normally every of this double words hold one JMP instruction with the
proper jump target address. The optiboot program can respect these JMP vector table too.
But if you use the linker avr-ld with the option --relax, all JMP instructions are replaced
by a RJMP, if this is possible for the target address.
This replacement of JMP instruction in the vector table by RJMP is not respected
by the optiboot program.
The optiboot program assume, that all interrupt vector numbers of a processor with
more than 8 kByte flash hold a JMP instruction.
For that reason a optiboot program with the VIRTUAL\_BOOT\_Partition option will not
work with a application program, which is linked with the --relax option.
The same problem exist, if the application program itself use a RJMP instruction in
one of the two critical interrupt vector positions.

Further you should notice, that you don't activate the BOOTRST fuse together with
with the usage of the VIRTUAL\_BOOT\_PARTITION option.
The reason is, that the start address of the boot-loader can be located to other
addresses with the VIRTUAL\_BOOT\_PARTITION option than without this option.
With the VIRTUAL\_BOOT\_PARTITION the start address can be placed to every
begin of a flash page. For the normal boot-loader support of the AVR the
start address can only respect the single, double, quadruple or octuple size of
a minimum boot-loader size as shown in figure~\ref{fig:pages} at page~\pageref{fig:pages}.


\section{Capabilities of the serial interface with the applied software}

Das Programm für die Erzeugung und Verarbeitung der elektrischen Signale ist in AVR-Assembler geschrieben.
The way of operation is taked over from the Application Note AVR305 of the ATmel Corporation.
However here are some special features build in.
For example it is respected, that we can not use the special bit-instructions SBI, CBI and SBIC for
any port address. You can use this instructions only up to the address 31 (0x1f).
For some higher port addresses up to 63 (0x3f) you can use special input (IN) and output (OUT)
instructions. If the addresses of the port are higher than this value, you must use
the instructions LDS and STS to access this ports. This instructions need 2 processor clocks for
execution and use the double flash memory (2 words or 4 byte) of the other instructions.
The changed cycle number of one loop pass without any additional delay will be automatically
determined by the program. 
This number of cycles is then taken into account for the calculation of the delay loop,
to achieve a correct time for the transmission of a bit.
The diagrams~\ref{fig:getch_timing} and~\ref{fig:putch_timing} should be used to
explain the work of the C-proprocessor.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\scalebox{0.9}{\includegraphics[]{../FIG/uart_getch_timing.eps}}
\caption{Possible variants of the getch function}
\label{fig:getch_timing}
\end{figure}


\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[]{../FIG/uart_putch_timing.eps}
\caption{Possible variants of the putch function}
\label{fig:putch_timing}
\end{figure}

Both loops are generated so that one cycle with the same conditions of INVERS option and
address range of the used ports use the same tic count.
So both functions can use the same function for generating the necessary delay.

\subsection{Computing of the delay time}
For the read-in function getch() is the half baud time needed.
From the detection of the start bit a total time of 1.5 times of the baud-time is delayed
to read the first data bit.
Therefore the base loop is designed for the half duration of a bit transmission.
This base loop is called twice in a special way, so that exactly twice the time is get.
Should one clock have been lost by the building of half the time and subsequent doubling,
this clock is compensated by adding a additional NOP command, so that the total time
is exactly correct for the transmission of one bit.
Because of the limited time resolution of the counter loop of 3 tics, a remainder of up to 2 clock tics
is compensated by adding a additional instruction with the right tic count (RJMP or NOP).
Of course, all this happens automatically, because only the loop time of the input function (getch)
and the output function (putch), the clock frequency of the processor and the desired baud rate
must be known. All other parameters like the number of clocks for a subroutine call (RCALL, RET)
are known for the traget processor.
A disadvantage of the base delay loop is the limited number of clocks for the delay.
With the used 8-bit counter only a maximum of 256*3 clocks is possible for the loop delay.
In addition there is the subroutine call of 7 tics, resulting in a half delay time of 775 tics.
This value must be doubled (delay for a whole bit time) and the loop-time of the input or output
function must be added to get the total time possible. Thus the highest achievable delay time is 1559 clocks.
With a \(16 MHz\) clock frequency you can not get a baud rate of 9600 Baud \(104.17\mu s\), because
the limit is only \(97.4\mu s\).
If a 16-bit counter is used by the delay loop, you would get an even worse resolution of time
because one loop cycle would take more time.
In addition, the 16-bit loop probably need to use the carry bit. The 8-bit counter don't use the carry bit.
This problem is solved by gradually doubling the delay times by doubling the delay loop call.
The C-prepocessor checks, if the initial value of the loop counter would match the 8-bit limit (255) at the
selected clock frequency and the desired baud rate.
In this cace the calculation is repeated for a double call of the base delay loop.
If the resulting initial value for the counting loop is still too high, the double call is doubled again.
Currently this procedure is repeated up to a factor 64 of the base time with the 8-bit counter.
At a clock frequency of \(16 MHz\) or \(20 MHz\) it is now possible to set the serial interface to 300 baud.
For every doubling of the delay time, a additional instruction (2 bytes) is required.
With the maximum count of doubling 6 additional instructions (12 byte) are required in the flash memory.
There is no attempt to add additional instructions to compensate the missing tics caused by
the prescaler for saving flash memory.
The baud time error remains clearly below \(1\%\), because the scaler is used only if necessary.
So the base loop has at least 127 passes with approximately 381 tics, The double delay time
makes no error because of the ''NOP'' compensation. Thus the error stays below 1:762 \(0.13\%\). 
The higher baud rates tend to get higher error for the transmission time, because
the time frame of the CPU clock does not match to the desired baud time.
The hardware UART has then the same problem, if it use the same CPU-clock.
If you wish to generate a baud rate of 230400 with a CPU clock rate of \(8 MHz\),
you can use either 34 tics with a baud time of \(4.25\mu s\) or
35 tics with a baud time of \(4.375\mu s\).
For the first case your baud time is \(2.08\%\) too short, for the
second case the baud time is \(0.8\%\) too long.

\subsection{Using more than one serial interface}

The assembler file soft\_uart.S is designed to be included by a different file which hold
a normal assembler source for the AVR family.
For the optiboot application this is done by the optiboot.S file.
The included file soft\_uart.S use many instructions of the
GNU C-preprocessor and includes another file uart\_delay.S for producing a delay loop
for the desired baud rate. Because this include can be repeated with other parameters,
you can produce up to 4 different delay loops for 4 different baud rates.
This feature use the file soft\_uart.S for generatung a getch and a putch function.
For both functions the file uart\_delay.S is included. But for the second call is
usually no new code generated because the calling parameters are the same.
Only if the parameters differ, a new delay loop would be generated.
Please note, that the callings for the delay loop are named with C-preprocessor macros.
This macros are set to a matching delay loop named DOUBLE\_DELAY\_CALL and SINGLE\_DELAY\_CALL,
if you include the uart\_delay.S file before the code of the serial input or output function.

Three constants must be set before any include of uart\_delay.S, named F\_CPU, BAUD\_RATE and 
LOOP\_TICS. The LOOP\_TICS must be set to the count of tics of the serial input or output
loop for one cycle without any additional delay (usually 9 tics).
For every generated delay loop, the total count of delay tics are saved in one of four
different constant names of the C-preprocessor BIT\_CLOCKS\_0, BIT\_CLOCKS\_1,
BIT\_CLOCKS\_2 and BIT\_CLOCKS\_3 . 
Before a new delay loop is generated, the C-preprocessor checks, if any of the already
generated code for a delay match the new requirement.
Because also the file soft\_uart.S must be included to generate the code for the 
serial input and serial output function, you can repeat this include for another
serial interface. But you must set a additional constant for differing the name
in the functions.
If you set the SOFT\_UART\_NUMBER to 1 (\#define SOFT\_UART\_NUMBER 1) before the \#include,
the serial input function is named getch\_1 and the serial output function
is named putch\_1. If you define a constant named NO\_SOFT\_UART\_TX before the
\#include of soft\_uart.S, no serial output function is generated by this include.
The same is done with the serial input function, if you specify the constant NO\_SOFT\_UART\_RX.

\subsection{Serial Input and Output with only one AVR Pin}

Sometimes it makes sense to operate the serial communication only with one pin,
to unlock one of the few IO pins of small AVRs for other use.
With a special circuit technology can be achieved that you can read in data in the
output pauses. The software solution of optiboot can only use the half-duplex operation
in any case.
Thus, at one time, only either data can be send or data can be received.
Normally the output pin with the TX function becomes high in the transmission pauses,
which prevent a data reading on the same pin.
But if the TX output pin is switched to input mode instead of the high level,
a external pull-up resistor can provide the required high level.
In contrast to the fixed high level now a externally connected TX signal
can pull down the level and let the input function read the low level.
A serial resistor in the connection between the common TX/RX pin of the AVR
with the external TX output can serve as pull-up resistor,
because the idle state if the interface is a high signal.
In addition, this serial resistor provides current limiting,
if both TX interfaces send at the same time.
The external RX interface must be connected directly to the common TX/RX pin
to enable the reading of the external RX interface.
The figure~\ref{fig:onewire-simple} should illustrate this simplest connection.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\scalebox{1.0}{\includegraphics[]{../FIG/OneWire_simple.eps}}
\caption{Possible serialconnection to a AVR with one Pin}
\label{fig:onewire-simple}
\end{figure}

Now is the problem, that the mostly full-duplex capable external interface will
read back the own output.
The communication program at the external side is usually unprepared for this condition.
One solution for this problem is to adapt the program at the external side to handle
this read back.
But I believe, that this is not a good idea, because this special version will 
have no maintenance or you must repeat this adaption for new versions constantly.
That's why I prefere a hardware solution.
A electronic circuit between the both endpoints must differ, from which side
the data are send.
A corresponding circuit suggestion is shown in figure~\ref{fig:onewire}

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\scalebox{0.5}{\includegraphics[]{../FIG/OneWire.eps}}
\caption{Circuit for suppressing the echoes}
\label{fig:onewire}
\end{figure}

With the first two NAND gates of the HCF4093 a flip-flop is build,
which is set or reset by the two other NAND gates of this chip.
The switching signals are get from from signals of a chain of inverting buffers
with Schmitt-trigger inputs (HC7414).
For one of this signals a additional C-R circuit (\(120 pF\) and \(3.3 k\Omega\) is
required to prevent switching at the wrong edge.
The flip-flop is switched with the 1-0 edge of the two transmission sides.
This changeover is only required at the edge of the start bit.
But additional switching with data bits will not hurt, if the flip-flop
is already in the right state.
When the external interface sends, the reception of the own data with the
external receiver is prevented. The external RX signal remains at high level.
With this additional circuit no software adaption is necessary.
You can use avrdude for example for the bootloader.
The circuit is largely independent of the selected baud rate.
I expect only problems with very high baud rates.
At 115200 baud the circuit operates well. Much higher baud rates can 
not be used in most cases with the software serial interface.


\section{Some examples of building a optiboot bootloader}

The first example is the building of a bootloader for the popular ATmega328P:

With no additional option a baudrate of 115200 with a clock frequency of \(16 MHz\) is selected.
For serial output the hardware interface is selected.
You should notice, that the systematic baud rate error is above 2\% with the hardware UART.
The second example with the same processor is done with a software solution for the serial interface.

\begin{verbatim}

Please note, that the software solution for the serial interface requires a little more flash memory,
but take use of only 1 boot page too. The systematic baud rate error is much smaller than the error with the hardware UART.
But the hardware UART has the advantage, that the input and output could be done simultaneous and is more tolerant against
short disturbance of the input signal.
For the software serial interface you can specify every digital IO-pin for input (UART\_RX) and output (UART\_TX). 
In this example the feature is used to automatically select the RX and TX of the hardware UART.
Please ignore the three warning messages, which tell you about the automatic selection.
The automatic IO-pin selection depends on the selected processor type and the selected UART number, if more than
one UART is available.
